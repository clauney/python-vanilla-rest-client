# python-vanilla-rest-client
A wrapper for requests that makes it easy to avoid writing and rewriting basics like auth and error handling to use API endpoints; and to provide complete interfaces for front end code to use rather than having to author API calls

## USAGE
(coming next, have a bunch in docstrings and main.py wrappers that call this, will throw them here. 

## SAMPLES
* Comcast MachineQ (https://swagger.machineq.net)
* Azure REST API (useful for any service, example shows iot/event hub but works for lots of services)
* Slack (webhook, have the other but need to add it)
* Pagerduty (Events API, have the older one but need to add it)
* New Relic (the metrics posting one, can add the mgmt one too)
